# PaySurity Platform Monorepo

This is the full PaySurity monorepo, including the marketing site, legal documents, and shared UI components.

## Structure
- `apps/marketing/` — Static marketing site HTML pages and blog posts
- `public/assets/images/` — Marketing and UI images
- `legal/` — Hosted HTML legal documents
- `packages/ui/` — Shared UI components (legal checkboxes, schemas, etc.)

## Next steps
1. Review and replace placeholder legal docs in `legal/`.
2. Rename and move images under `public/assets/images/` as needed.
3. Add module-specific apps under `apps/` (e.g., `super-admin`, `merchant`, `pos`).
4. Initialize Git and push to GitHub, then connect to Vercel for deployment.
